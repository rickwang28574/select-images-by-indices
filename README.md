# select-images-by-indices
 This Python script selects a specific set of images from a folder containing images numbered from 1 to 1000, and copies them to a specified destination folder. The script is designed to help users quickly and easily select images based on specific indices. It uses the os and shutil libraries in Python to traverse the source folder and copy the selected images to the destination folder. Users can modify the script to select images based on their specific needs by editing the src_folder, dst_folder, and selected_indices variables. This script is useful for anyone who needs to perform batch image selection and copying for data analysis, machine learning, or other purposes.
